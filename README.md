## Data Preparation
Add dataset that needs to be analysed under `data/foldername`. As an example dataset we added the cats from the TOSCA dataset [1]. 
We used the shot features [2,3] and a wrapper code for Matlab that was written by Emanuele Rodola.
To obtain the code please find further instructions on their [website](http://www.vision.deis.unibo.it/research/80-shot).
We included some precomputed shot features for one example dataset. 

## Matrix-valued shortest paths
Use the `main()` function to setup the graph and to calculate the matrix-valued shortest paths. In the end the indirect paths that are shorter than the direct ones are visualized.
